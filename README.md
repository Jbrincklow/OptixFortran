# Optix
AeroLab Optimization Software

Created by:

* Dr Doug Hunsaker (professor, Utah State University; director, USU AeroLab)
* Josh Hodson (graduate student, Utah State University)

Restored the original Fortran version. The initial commit was missing the myjson.f90 and json.f90 files needed to compile this version.

This is the Legacy Fortran Optix version. There is a Legacy Python Optix version, stay tuned for that fork.

Optix is a gradient-based optimization tool designed with aerodynamics in mind. Recognizing that aerodynamic functions are often computationally intensive, Optix has been designed to be as light-weight as possible, while offering an intuitive API.
