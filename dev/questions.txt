Should s, the search direction vector, be normalized?
Why do we check to see if the second point in the line search is larger than the first? This doesn't seem to be anything special...
Where does the formula for the optimum alpha in the simple line search come from?
There could be a lot done to make the line search and quadratic line search similar from a code structure perspective.
Why does the quadratic line search determine a maximum number of adjustments to alpha to attempt?

Possible improvements
Within line searches, call alpha "step_size", until the actual alpha is found.
